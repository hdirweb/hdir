    Croatian Association for Cancer Research supports the EACRâ€™s statement on
    threats to cancer research


    Cancer research is a global effort, and recent disruptions to US funding and infrastructure have far-reaching consequences. These challenges threaten not only US-based researchers but also international collaboration and the progress of life-saving cancer research and treatment.


    Alongside the European Association for Cancer Research (EACR) and other organizations, we stand in solidarity with our US colleagues and call for sustainable solutions to protect global cancer research.
